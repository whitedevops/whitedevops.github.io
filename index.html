				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>
					At WHITE devOPS, we design and develop digital products for web, mobile and embedded systems: the source code is our art.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our goal of simplicity, precision and perfection in the result constantly drives us to innovate, to grow a solid reliability, to go the extra mile … And we love it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Time is precious. We strongly believe that computing allows the Man to live better by offering him the time and the opportunity to concentrate on the essentials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Digital technology has changed our world and our perception over this one.<br>
					It gives us to share some amazing things and it is up to us, developers, to provide the whole World with memorable experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is our duty, our job, and we do it with conviction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each of our projects follows the DevOps movement that allows a complete and granular control over our productions.<br>
					We never stand back, we work hard so that every second spent with our products is special and unique.

				<h1>Our Expertise</h1>
				<p>
					"DevOps" is the connection between "development" and "operations".
				</p>
				<p>
					We hold ourselves to control each one of the products we ship on the fingertips, from the first to the last minute.<br>
					And we take great care to ensure that everything is done cleanly.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the heart of our solid expertise:
