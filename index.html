			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>
				At WHITE devOPS, we design and develop digital products for web, mobile and embedded systems: the source code is our art.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our goal of simplicity, precision and perfection in the result constantly drives us to innovate, to grow a solid reliability, to go the extra mile … And we love it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Time is precious. We strongly believe that computing allows the Man to live better by offering him the time and the opportunity to concentrate on the essentials.
			</p>
			<p>
				Digital technology has changed our world and our perception over this one.<br>
				It gives us to share some amazing things and it is up to us, developers, to provide the whole World with memorable experiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is our duty, our job, and we do it with conviction.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each of our projects follows the DevOps movement that allows a complete and granular control over our productions.<br>
				We never stand back, we work hard so that every second spent with our products is special and unique.

				"DevOps" is the connection between "development" and "operations".<br>
				We hold ourselves to control each one of the products we ship on the fingertips, from the first to the last minute.<br>
				And we take great care to ensure that everything is done cleanly.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is the heart of our solid expertise:
